## Neural-Network-for-WBC-Classification

Dataset used:
https://bit.ly/3pM3Ptf
Jung, C. W-Net model and generated WBC images. 2022. https://bit.ly/2KAffwM. Accessed: 2022-3-25.

The dataset is available for educational and scientific purposes
The dataset is high quality and well processed, so the obtained accuracy is high even with a simple model like what is shown here
You might need to edit the model layers to achieve higher accuracy for your dataset

code_interface - This folder contains screenshots of the code user interface run on windows powershell
output_directory - Your directory would look like this after running the code
output_directory/image_set_to_train - The dataset for training should have similar structure to this folder

Directory Instructions:
At start your project folder should contain only image_set_to_train, wbc_classification.py and wbc_classification.ipynb (if using jupyter notebook)
Run the terminal and run the python file OR run the jupyter notebook from inside this project folder and run the code blocks

Used Packages / Requirements:
Make sure the following requirements are fulfilled
Python version used is 3.10.9
Numpy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Tensorflow (According to python version)
Sklearn

Side Note:
The code block used has repetitions to allow it to be taken out and used in other project.
