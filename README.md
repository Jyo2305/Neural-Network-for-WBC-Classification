## Neural-Network-for-WBC-Classification

Dataset used:<br />
https://bit.ly/3pM3Ptf<br />
Jung, C. W-Net model and generated WBC images. 2022. https://bit.ly/2KAffwM. Accessed: 2023-3-25.<br />
<br />
The dataset is available for educational and scientific purposes<br />
The dataset is high quality and well processed, so the obtained accuracy is high even with a simple model like what is shown here<br />
You might need to edit the model layers to achieve higher accuracy for your dataset<br />
<br />
code_interface - This folder contains screenshots of the code user interface run on windows powershell<br />
output_directory - Your directory would look like this after running the code<br />
output_directory/image_set_to_train - The dataset for training should have similar structure to this folder<br />
<br />
Directory Instructions:<br />
At start your project folder should contain only image_set_to_train, wbc_classification.py and wbc_classification.ipynb (if using jupyter notebook)<br />
Run the terminal and run the python file OR run the jupyter notebook from inside this project folder and run the code blocks<br />
<br />
